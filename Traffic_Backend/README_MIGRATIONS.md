Alembic Migrations (Traffic_Backend)

Quickstart:

1. Install backend requirements (in your venv):

```pwsh
python -m pip install -r Traffic_Backend/requirements.txt
```

2. From the repository root, run alembic commands in the `Traffic_Backend` folder:

```pwsh
cd Traffic_Backend
# create an autogenerated revision
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "initial"
# apply migrations (or stamp if DB already has the schema)
alembic upgrade head
# OR if tables were created manually already:
alembic stamp head
```

Notes:
- `env.py` configures the DB engine from `Traffic_Backend/db_config.py`, which reads `DATABASE_URL` or the `MYSQL_*` env vars and falls back to SQLite for local dev.
- If you use MySQL with special characters in the password, set `DATABASE_URL` to an URL-encoded value in the shell before running alembic.
